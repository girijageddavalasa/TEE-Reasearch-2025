# TEE-Reasearch-2025

This work investigates how system-level stress—such as increased CPU and memory usage—affects the success of timing-based side-channel attacks aimed at stealing secret information. We simulate a secure processing environment and measure execution times for digit-based inputs (0–9) under varying stress levels (normal, 0.1s, 0.2s, and 0.5s delays). Using ML model, we find that moderate stress of 0.1s improves attack accuracy significantly up to 82%, whereas higher stress 0.5s introduces variability that reduces accuracy down to 62%. These findings suggest that while some stress can enhance timing leakage, excessive stress may reduce an attacker’s effectiveness. Our study offers a novel perspective on how system stress influences side-channel vulnerability, with implications for securing trusted computing environments (TEEs) and also we try extract the PIN using ML model using the different parameters of execution time, cpu load and etc …
